Data Analysis Project 1 :

In this Project, I have analysed the Vehicle Accident Data with help of SQL Server Management Tool and SQL Queries. Where I have taken below requirements and prepared the solutions with sql queries to make appropriate decisions to reduce the accidents,   

Query 1 : How many acccidents  have occurred in urban versus Rural Areas?

Query 2 : Which day of the month more accidents happened from highest to least ?

Query 3 : What is the average age of vehicles invloved in accidents based on their type?

Query 4 : Is there any Trend in accidents based on the Age of the vehicle ?

Query 5 : Are there any specific weather condition for severe accidents ?

Query 6 : Do accidents often involve impact on the left hand side of vehicles?

Query 7 : Are there any relationship between journey purposes and severity of the accident

Query 8 : Calculate the average age of vehicles invloved in accidents, considering Day light and point of Impact
